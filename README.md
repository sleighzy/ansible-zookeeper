# Apache ZooKeeper

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sleighzy/ansible-zookeeper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sleighzy/ansible-zookeeper)

Ansible role for installing and configuring Apache ZooKeeper

Tested with :
- RedHat 7 :heavy_check_mark:
- RedHat 8 :heavy_check_mark:
- Debian 10 :heavy_check_mark:

This role can be used to install and cluster multiple ZooKeeper nodes, this uses
all hosts defined for the "zookeeper-nodes" group in the inventory file by
default. All servers are added to the zoo.cfg file along with the leader and
election ports.

## Starting and Stopping ZooKeeper services

- The ZooKeeper service can be started via: `systemctl start zookeeper`
- The ZooKeeper service can be stopped via: `systemctl stop zookeeper`

## Dependencies

No dependencies

## Example Playbook

    - hosts: zookeeper-nodes
      roles:
         - sleighzy.zookeeper

## Linting

Linting should be done using
[ansible-lint](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-lint/)

    pip3 install ansible-lint --user

## Testing

This module uses [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as a
testing framework.

As per the
[Molecule Installation guide](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html)
this should be done using a virtual environment. The commands below will create
a Python virtual environment and install Molecule including the Docker driver.

    virtualenv . && \
        source ./bin/activate && \
        pip install 'molecule[docker]' && \
        molecule create

Run playbook and tests. Linting errors need to be corrected before Molecule will
execute any tests.

    molecule test

The below command can be used to run the playbook without the tests. This can be
run multiple times when making changes to the role, and ensuring that operations
are idempotent.

    molecule converge

Tear down Molecule tests and Docker container.

    molecule destroy
