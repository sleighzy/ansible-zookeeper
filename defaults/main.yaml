# Configuration variables

# The unit of time for ZooKeeper translated to milliseconds.
# This governs all ZooKeeper time dependent operations. It is used for heartbeats and timeouts especially.
# Note that the minimum session timeout will be two ticks.
zookeeper_ticktime: 3000

# Amount of time, in ticks (see tickTime), to allow followers to connect and sync to a leader.
# Increased this value as needed, if the amount of data managed by ZooKeeper is large.
zookeeper_init_limit: 10

# Amount of time, in ticks (see tickTime), to allow followers to sync with ZooKeeper.
# If followers fall too far behind a leader, they will be dropped.
zookeeper_sync_limit: 5

# The directory where ZooKeeper in-memory database snapshots and, unless specified in dataLogDir, the transaction log of updates to the database.
# This location should be a dedicated disk that is ideally an SSD.
# For more information, see the ZooKeeper Administration Guide (https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperAdmin.html).
zookeeper_data_dir: /var/lib/zookeeper
# The location where the transaction log is written to. If you don’t specify this option, the log is written to dataDir.
# By specifying this option, you can use a dedicated log device, and help avoid competition between logging and snapshots.
# For more information, see the ZooKeeper Administration Guide (https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperAdmin.html).
zookeeper_data_log_dir: /var/lib/zookeeper

# This is the port where ZooKeeper clients will listen on. This is where the Brokers will connect to ZooKeeper. Typically this is set to 2181.
zookeeper_client_port: 2181

# The maximum allowed number of client connections for a ZooKeeper server. To avoid running out of allowed connections set this to 0 (unlimited).
zookeeper_max_client_cnxns: 60

# When enabled, ZooKeeper auto purge feature retains the autopurge.snapRetainCount most recent snapshots and the corresponding transaction logs
# in the dataDir and dataLogDir respectively and deletes the rest.
zookeeper_autopurge_snap_retain_count: 3
# The time interval in hours for which the purge task has to be triggered. Set to a positive integer (1 and above) to enable the auto purging.
zookeeper_purge_interval: 0
